# Elixir Scripts

These are scripts that I have written in Elixir while going through the tutorials.

This repository shall contain the code used for my CSC 590 Secure Computing course, where I plan to implement a one-time pad encryption algorithm that should run very efficiently on the processor but less so on the memory.

Eventually, I plan on using the Phoenix web framework for Elixir, and as such, I have begun taking sporadic notes on setting up my environment in [Phoenix.md](./Phoenix.md)
